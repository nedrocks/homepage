I have been lucky to have interview training from small companies, large companies,
and external consultants. I've practiced my skills while conducting at least 750
interviews over my career. I'd go so far as to call myself a well-trained interviewer.

In case you've never been part of a technical interview, I'll give you a quick run down. 
Your interview usually lasts between three to eight hours with each individual interview 
taking between 30 minutes and one hour. They often start with introductions and a quick 
5-15 minute question about a problem the candidate solved in the past. Something like "Ah, 
I see you have worked in React, tell me about the problem you solved with the bloo blah 
blee."[^1]

The majority of the reamining time involves one or more technical questions. Sometimes the 
candidate knows how many to expect and what would a good, great, or excellent performance 
looks like, although this is pretty rare. The questions are mostly one of the following 
types.

1. Brain teaser - A logic puzzle that tries to test for creativity and flexibility of your mind. For example, "If I shrank you to the size of a nickel and put you in a blender, how
would you escape?"[^2]
1. Fermi question - An estimation problem where the candidate sets up the constraints and
attempts to arrive at an answer. The answer doesn't matter, just how the candidate thinks
through the problem. For example, "How many golf balls would fit inside a 747?"
1. Algorithm/Data structure question - A question the candidate must think of an algorithm 
or data structure to solve the posed question and then write it in code on a whiteboard
or in a code editor. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)'s focus is mostly algorithm 
and data structure question training.
1. System Design / Architecture - A question where the candidate designs a much larger
system than can be built in an hour and usually draws boxes and lines on a whiteboard.
Generally this tests bigger problem solving and communication skills. For example,
"design Twitter" is a very common system design question.
1. "Real-World" problems - A candidate solves a "real-world" (generally fabricated) bug
or feature similar to what they would work on if hired. For instance, I've had people
redesign a homepage using live APIs.

After somewhere between three to eight of these interviews, you're done. Easy right?

#### Why these questions
So now that you know how the process goes down, 

I recently estimated I've conducted between 700 and 1,000 interviews for technical
positions in my career. That's a lot. If you average 50 weeks of work per year, and each
week average 2 candidate interviews, it would take you 10 years.

In each of these interviews I attempt to disect a person's background and confidently
bucket them into one of four categories: Strong Hire, Hire, No Hire, Strong No Hire with
an accompanying written rationale. 

[^1]: Actually, at Amazon we also ask questions about (Leadership Principles)[https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles] in this block which tend to be far more abstract, but
still sound like similarly-phrased open-ended questions.
[^2]: These questions are very seldomly asked anymore but were extremely common in the
aughts.
