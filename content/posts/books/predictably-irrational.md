Overall a fantastic book detailing human behavior from a psychological and economic point of view. My favorite chapter was Cost of Social Norms, as it opened my eyes to a new point of view on interactions in a professional context. Dan Ariely does an amazing job detailing caveats of human irrationality throughout the book and I would say a must read for anyone.

## Summary

### Chapter 1: The Truth About Relativity

* Objectivity is nearly impossible
    - how much is something actually worth?
* People make relative decisions on worth.
    - They like the better of some options but not the best
    - Think bread makers - when they don't sell because they are new, introduce a second, more expensive bread maker and the cheaper one will sell.

### Chapter 2: The Fallacy of Supply & Demand 

* Demand can be manufactured
    - Black pearls made in high demand simply by positioning.
* Anchoring - the first price you hear foro a product or category tends to stick.
* Starbucks
    - Positioned itself differently to remove Dunkin Donuts' price anchor for coffee (why should I pay $4 for a cup of coffee?)
    - Once you go a few times, your decision making for going again is akin to seeing a line out the front door (it's clearly popular because I've been.)
* Tom Sawyer showed a low supply product (painting fence) and raised demand.
* What if we are the sum of our first, naÃ¯ve, myopic decisions?
* Continually question our decisions
    - How much benefit does something actually bring?
* Prices can influence willingness to pay
    - Demand is not entirely separate from supply
* People like to make well thought out decisions but want to arrive at a, probably, preconceived conclusion

### Chapter 3: Cost of Zero Cost

* `Zero!` is a powerful marketing tactic
* The laws of demand tend to break down with `Zero!`
* So powerful, sometimes (or often) makes consumers miscalculate outcomes
* All transactions have upside and downside. Free has no downside with some guaranteed upside.
* AMZN shipping for free vs $.20
    - Massive difference in spending when free, even though 20 cents (1 Franc) was next to nothing.
* Zero calories vs. 1 calorie
* Paying for dinner
    - Each incremental dollar paid is less pain (diminishing sensitivity) and thus it's always better for one person to pay the whole bill instead of split.

### Chapter 4: The Cost of Social Norms

* Social norms vs. market norms
    - Social much stronger but they cannot be mixed
    - Once market norms are brought in, social norms will likely not return
* Do work as favor is okay & fair wage okay, but for small $ amount won't work
* Gifts work, but not when a price tag is attached
* When price tag attached, gifts just the same as market norms
* Doing tasks after having heard sentences like "High paying salary" lead people to be more market minded & less social (compared to phrases like "It's cold outside") 
    - Ask for help less
    - Less likely to offer help
    - **Thus** even mentioning prices move us into market norms.
* Picking up kids @ daycare: social vs $ penalty
    - Once reversed from social -> market -> social, the parental behavior didn't change.
    - Social norm goes away for a long time.
* Gifts vs. Cash bonuses
* Police & firefighters vs. border / customs agents
* Education goals
* Burning man & sharing economy
* Seinfeld maid & dating.

### Chapter 5: The Power of a Free Cookie

* Filene's basement dress sale
    - All social norms go out the window b/c of huge savings
* Cookies from coworker
    - When free, I'll consider hunger, calories, love of cookies, social pressures of taking too many.
    - When they cost $0.05 I won't consider social norms
* Starburst experiment
    - $0.01 per candy obeys demand laws
    - Free people take FEWER! (odd because doesn't follow rational market economics)
* When price is not part of exchange, we become less selfish maximizers & care about welfare of others
    - Last sushi piece
* Effort is somewhere between market and social norms
* Carbon taxes skews the line because it may increase carbon.
* When emotions are piqued it's hard to take others emotions into account.

### Chapter 6: Influence of Arrousal

* When aroused, choices are different than when not
    - Hard to predict behavior
* Maybe true for other emotions as well

### Chapter 7: The Problem of Procrastination & Self Control

* Credit usually defaults or becomes expensive due to procrastination
* US personal saving rates are < 0%
* Impulses divert from long term goals
* Pro - for; cras -> tomorrow
* Study allowing students to set deadlines (A) vs imposed deadlines (B) vs no deadlines (end of semester) (C)
    - Grades, in order, were B, A, C
* Parental voice causes us to pay attention
* Precommitting to healthcare (e.g. refunded deposit to get cholesterol checked) may help us actually get it done.
* Ford cars needed checkups, but differed per model
    - Made the 5,000; 10,000; 25,000 mile checkups
        + Perfect mix of authoritative & self imposed
    - Initially a tough sell internally b/c mustang is different from F-150

### Chapter 8: The High Price of Ownership

* Duke basketball tickets
    - People stand inline for a long long time to join a lottery
    - Those who get tix value the tickets really high because of an emotional response
    - Those who don't value them really low because they see the monetary value.
    - Difference is large ($2400 vs. $175)
* We fall in ove with what we already have
* We focus on what we may lose instead of gain (when selling)
* We assume others will see transaction from our perspective
* Virtual ownership
    - Think long running eBay auctions (like I already own it)
    - Upgrading for free for a limited time (downgrade rarely happens)
* Moving from ownership to pre ownership feels like a loss

### Chapter 9: Keeping Doors Open

* We work hard to keep doors open
    - Buy bless and whistles just in case
    - Picking majors in school
* Maximizing profit while clicking (game, experiment)
    - People always try to keep doors open even if those doors don't maximize profit
* Sad side are when we don't realize there are slowly closing doors
    - Kids growing up
* Donkey starving to death between two bales of hay

### Chapter 10: Effect of expectations

* Beer test with adding balsamic vinegar
    - If not told, peple prefer balsamic to crappy beer
    - If told about vinegar before, people hate it
    - If told about afterward, people like it as much as if never told
* Expectations drive results
    - Joshua Bell in subway
    - Do settings really matter (probably)
* Names on menus
* Pepsi Challenge
* Expectations & stereotypes
    - Asians good at math, women bad at math; When Asian women asked to do math, it depended on precondition -- were they thinking about their cultural background or gender background before?
* Alexander Pope: Blessed is he who expects nothing

### Chapter 11: The Power of Price

* Placebo surgeries can sometimes prove the surgery has not added benefit
* A more expensive medication (even if medication is a placebo) has a stronger effect
* If a placebo is primed (SoBe causes better test taking) the higher price still has a stronger effect
* Divine touch from kings
* Physicians prescribe placebos a lot (antibiotic placebos for viral infections)
* Are placebos good or bad?
    - W/o using placebos we can't improve or test
    - W/ placebos people may die now
* Airborne was placebo that worked (but ended up being screwed up by warnings on the packaging.)

### Chapter 12: The Cycle of Distrust

* Spam email; fine print; marketing ploys
* Free money experiment
    - Giving away free money (printed on sign how much)
    - Only 1% of people walking by stopped for $1, only 19% for $50
    - All believed there was a catch
* Tragedy of the commons & game theory
* Snake oil salesmen
* Lying on dating sites -- You're expected to lie so when you don't it's bad
* True statements when "endorsed" by companies (DNC, RNC, P&G) breed mistrust
    - Same statements w/o endorsements do not.
* Listening to speakers with brochure vs consumer reports -- people tended to think the speakers were better with consumer report instead of brochure.
* Transparency is rare for a company

### Chapter 13: The Context of Our Character, Part 1

* People steal, a lot
* Difference between robbing & white collar crime
    - Think over deducting on taxes vs. bank robbery
* Experiments tempting people to cheat
    - When tempted, people cheat a little, but could do a lot more
    - When asked to remember 10 commandments, no cheating!
        + Even if they didn't know more than a couple of them -- just the thought of a code of laws was enough.
* Seems superego keeps people from cheating egregiously
    - Cheating a little does not activate superego
* Problem is some cheat a lot
* Could professional oaths help solve issue?
    - Degradation of proffesions with oaths (doctors, lawyers)
    - Seems people are tempted to cheat for personal gains (Tragedy of Commons)
* Asking people to sign a non-existant honor code stopped cheating
    - Thus, just thinking about existence of a code stops people

### Chapter 14: The Context of Our Character, Part 2

* Dollar bills make people more honest
* Removing direct link to money (coca cola in fridge) makes people less so
* Would Enron guys have robbed from old ladies? (no) but they took money from them indirectly from pension funds.
* Experiment: Give tokens worth $.50 that could be exchanged 12 feet away vs giving $.50 directly. Way more cheating in former case.
* Cheating when reporting losses, wardrobing, expense reports
* Human nature can cause people to be dishonest when not directly connected with $$$
* Frequent flyer miles BS with airlines; Credit card companies
    - Essentially robbery, but not directly so feels more okay.
* What happens when we no longer use cash directly?

### Chapter 15: Beer & Free Lunches

* People try to make unique orders (in our culture, not necessarily in others)
* Best utility when ordering is to order first, or at least say your desire out load to get "dibs" on it.
* Free lunches shouldn't exist because they should be eaten already
