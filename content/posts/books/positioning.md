[Positioning](https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586) is a short read from the 1980s that speaks to marketing in an overcommunicated society. Clearly more relevant today than ever, Al Ries addresses the phenomenon of being second to market in a competitive field. The case studies in the last 5 chapters help drive home the points. Strong introduction to market and product positioning. *7 / 10*
