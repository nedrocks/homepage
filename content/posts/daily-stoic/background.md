I've begun going through the 366 daily stoic meditations provided by (The Daily Stoic)[https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736]. I decided that there's no better way to distill my knowledge and share it with others than putting it in a daily update. I will likely falter and miss updating some days, but look forward to reading my musings on a few hundred meditations on Stoicism.
