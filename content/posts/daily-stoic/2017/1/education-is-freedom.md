Epictetus states that only the educated are free. That it’s not enough to say only the free should be educated. Cause and effect — cast off the shackles by learning.

Historically, learning has driven me. Not necessarily learning via an organized process, but understanding a concept down to the basics. Once I feel I understand, once I have [forged my ring](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters#Collar), I truly own that lesson. Freedom, in my view, is understanding and truly owning all of the lessons. 

The author reminds us to remember that learning grants freedom on the days when we feel distracted. On the days where we choose to waste time instead of read or learn, to remember that it is not what we have learned that allows us freedom but the act of continual study that grants it to us.
