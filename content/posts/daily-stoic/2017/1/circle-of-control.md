After falling behind doing one of these a day by about a week and doing a lot of reflection in a single day, I'm noticing a ton of repetition. In fact, circle of control was something that I reflected on [here](../control-and-choice/), [here](../if-you-want-to-be-steady/), [here](../if-you-want-to-be-unsteady/), and [here](../what-we-control-what-we-dont/). Not that this doesn't bear repeating, but circle of choice has started to sound like the circle of dead horses.

The author brings up a new point today though about how a stoic only controls his mind. His body even lives outside of his control. A calming conclusion for existential dread around singularity.
