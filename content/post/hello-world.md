I've had "Make a personal website" on my todo list for about 5 years now. It always seemed daunting. At the end of the day, I continued to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and thus never pulled the trigger on it. But here we are, a reasonable website that's not great, but I'm happy with the first step. As a goal for 2017, I plan to add my book reviews here, and attempt to write a blog post four times per month. Let's see how it goes.

For now, happy 2017!
