Clarifying my intentions to myself has been one of the strongest changes I've made over the past few years. I can't say that in every stage and step of life I knew what my end goals are, but I'm getting closer.

The big question people like to ask is "where do you see yourself in 5 (or 10 or 15) years?" My answer five years ago, like most people in their mid-twenties, was probably lacklackluster. I doubt I'd have predicted that in five years I'd have started a few companies, improved my professional confidence, have a beautiful girlfriend who I plan on marrying, and a stronger understanding of myself. 

If I try really hard to remember what I wanted when I was 27, I remember wanting to have a stronger personal life, to have a fulfilling romantic relationship, to win more (where winning wasn't well defined,) and to enjoy my professional life more. I can say with great confidence that I achieved all of those goals, but not because I was striving to those ends.

Today, I can say that I'm very happy with where I am, but going through lots of change where I don't have clear intentions. This day's meditations have made me realize that I need a good framework for what my intentions and goals are. This will guide my actions, help me know if I'm on the right track, and let me know when I've finished.
