Let's face it, I get wrapped up in my career. I tend to choose it over other aspects of my life, frequently over things that I should do. I stopped rolling Jiu Jitsu because I took up a new job. I stopped flying because I took on more responsibilities at work. At the end of the day, career should not be a life sentence, and this resonates. It's also difficult to see the forest for the trees.

The image of a lawyer breathing his last breath while defending a client he doesn't know or care for is stark.
